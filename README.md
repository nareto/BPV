README
======

This repository contains the python code I developed for my Master's Thesis in Mathematics, a copy of which is in the root directory. In Section 4.1 there is a brief description of the BPV and pattern_manipulation modules.

The `notebooks` directory contains the various ipython notebooks I used to run the numerical tests and plot the graphs in the thesis: they are somewhat disorganized - use at your own risk.

The `data` directory contains the probability distributions used as inputs for the problem and various saved python objects from the notebooks (through the `pickle` module).
